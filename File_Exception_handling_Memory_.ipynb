        "- Ans: Interpreted languages are executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime, translating source code into machine code on the fly. They are generally more portable because the same source code can be run on any platform with the appropriate interpreter. However, they tend to be slower due to the overhead of runtime translation. Errors are detected at runtime, which means the program may run until it encounters an error. Examples include Python and JavaScript.\n",
        "Compiled languages are translated into machine code by a compiler before execution, creating an executable file. This machine code is specific to the target platform, making compiled languages less portable. However, they tend to be faster because the machine code is executed directly by the hardware without the need for runtime translation. Errors are detected at compile-time, which means the program will not run until all errors are fixed. Examples include C and C++."

Reference counting keeps track of how many references an object has. When an object's reference count drops to zero, it becomes eligible for garbage collection and its memory is released. However, reference counting alone cannot handle reference cycles, where objects refer to each other, preventing their reference counts from ever reaching zero. In such cases, their reference counts will never drop to zero, and they would leak memory without an additional mechanism. Python's garbage collector includes a cycle detection algorithm that periodically identifies and collects these unreachable cycles of objects.\n"

        "\n",
        "- **Memory Leaks**: Even with automatic garbage collection, memory leaks can occur, especially with circular references where objects reference each other, preventing their reference counts from reaching zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **High Memory Consumption**: Python's dynamic typing and the overhead of objects can lead to higher memory usage compared to languages like C or C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Garbage Collection Overhead**: While automatic garbage collection simplifies development, it can introduce performance overhead, particularly with latency spikes during collection cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Fragmentation:** Dynamic memory allocation can lead to fragmentation, where free memory is scattered, making it difficult to allocate large contiguous blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Limited Manual Control**: Python abstracts away much of the memory management, offering limited manual control compared to languages where developers can explicitly allocate and deallocate memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Memory Errors**: When dealing with large datasets or inefficient code, programs can encounter memory errors if they consume more memory than available.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Complexity of Analysis**: Analyzing memory-related issues in Python can be complex due to the intricacies of its memory allocation system.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Potential for Slower Runtimes**: Python programs might experience slower runtimes because the program might hold onto freed memory within the interpreter instead of releasing it to the operating system.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Memory Bloat**: Applications may load large amounts of data into memory but fail to deallocate it when it's no longer in use, leading to memory bloat.\n",
